## PM Conductor — operating rules

This repo is managed by the `pm` plugin. The conductor sits ABOVE OpenSpec and Superpowers.
Epics are **lane-agnostic** (openspec | superpowers | claude-code | decision | external);
OpenSpec is one lane. Stories come from each epic's source (OpenSpec `tasks.md`, a Superpowers
plan, or a manual list). Follow these rules:

1. **Detours** — when something blocks the active epic, CLASSIFY before fixing:
   - *Minimal* (small, self-contained, no design ambiguity): fix → test → commit → push,
     then run `/pm:detour --minimal "<what>"` so it is recorded in `.conductor/detours.log`.
     Then resume.
   - *Substantial* (own design / changes shared behavior / multi-step): run `/pm:detour`.
     It becomes its own epic in the appropriate lane (OpenSpec proposal, Superpowers plan,
     etc.); PUSH the current epic onto the detour stack in `.conductor/state.json` with a
     concrete reason and `reconcileOnResume`.
2. **State of record is `.conductor/state.json`.** After any change to epics, status,
   priority, or the detour stack, re-render with `/pm:status`. Never hand-edit `PROJECT.md`.
3. **Resuming after a detour** — use `/pm:resume`. If the popped frame had
   `reconcileOnResume`, run the reconcile gate (reconciler agent) BEFORE writing code.
4. **Honcho** — on every PUSH and POP, also write a one-line memory to Honcho
   ("paused X for Y" / "resumed X, reconciled vs Y") so the relationship survives outside
   this repo.
5. **Keep `tasks.md` checkboxes truthful** — they are the source of truth for story progress.
6. **Roadmap as backlog** — work you intend to do but haven't proposed yet can be
   registered now with `/pm:epic add … --status planned` (any lane). Planned epics show
   as ordered backlog in `PROJECT.md` and a `planned: N` count in the briefing, without a
   "no change on disk" warning; `/pm:sync` flips an openspec planned epic to untriaged once
   its change is proposed. Have a roadmap doc? Read it in-session and load each item this way.
